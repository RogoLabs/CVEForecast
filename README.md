# CVE Forecast

**CVE Forecast** is a sophisticated, automated platform that leverages multiple time series forecasting models to predict the number of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). It provides a comprehensive, data-driven view of future trends in vulnerability disclosures, all accessible through a sleek, interactive web dashboard.

> **Latest Update (July 2025)**: Enhanced model stability and performance with improved error handling and numerical stability. Added support for dynamic forecast periods and better model evaluation metrics.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Optimized for Production**: Focused on reliability and performance with CPU-optimized models
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Dynamic Forecasting**: Automatically adapts forecast periods based on current date

- **Advanced Forecasting Engine**: Features a carefully curated selection of models including Linear Regression, Prophet, ARIMA, and Theta models, with robust error handling and numerical stability improvements. Deep learning models are available but disabled by default for CPU-only environments.
- **Automated CI/CD Pipeline**: Employs GitHub Actions for a fully automated daily workflow, including data ingestion, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
- **Interactive Web Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface for visualizing historical data, comparing model forecasts, and analyzing performance metrics.
- **Rigorous Model Evaluation**: Systematically ranks models based on a variety of performance metrics, ensuring the most accurate forecasts are always highlighted.
- **In-Depth Technical Documentation**: A comprehensive guide to the system's architecture, data pipeline, and forecasting models.
